# Advanced_Predictive_Analytics_Problems

# Predictive Analytics Final Solutions

Welcome to my repository containing the solved problems from my **Predictive Analytics**. This collection provides insights into various predictive analytics techniques using real-world problem-solving scenarios.

## Repository Overview

This repository includes solutions to multiple predictive analytics problems, organized into five key topics:

### Files Included:
1. **Decision_Tree_Gini_Index.xlsx**: 
   - **Description**: This file includes a detailed solution to decision tree splits using the **Gini Index** criterion. It illustrates how to determine the optimal split point by calculating Gini indices and combined Gini scores.

2. **Clustering_Normalization.xlsx**: 
   - **Description**: This file demonstrates **clustering analysis** using normalized variables. The sheet shows the assignment of data points to clusters based on calculated distances.

3. **Regression_Analysis.xlsx**:
   - **Description**: This file contains solutions related to **linear regression analysis**. It calculates coefficients (e.g., `b0`, `b1`) and applies a regression model to predict target variables.

4. **Binary_Classification_Logistic_Regression.xlsx**:
   - **Description**: This file includes problems related to **binary classification** using **logistic regression**. It helps in understanding the decision boundary for predicting binary outcomes.

5. **Centroid_Clustering.xlsx**:
   - **Description**: This sheet focuses on **k-means clustering** or centroid-based clustering, detailing the calculation of distances from centroids and clustering assignment.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: All solutions were calculated and documented using Excel for easy visualization and analysis.

## Purpose of the Repository
This repository serves as a portfolio to demonstrate my expertise in predictive analytics techniques and to share my problem-solving skills with others interested in data science and analytics. The solutions are designed to be educational for those looking to understand practical approaches to solving analytics problems.

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understand how to apply **decision trees** for classification and splitting.
- Learn about **clustering** techniques for grouping data based on similarity.
- Apply **regression models** to predict outcomes from continuous variables.
- Implement **logistic regression** to classify data into binary outcomes.
