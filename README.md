# Predictive Analytics Final Solutions

Welcome to my repository containing the solved problems from my **Predictive Analytics**. This collection provides insights into various predictive analytics techniques using real-world problem-solving scenarios.

## Repository Overview

This repository includes solutions to multiple predictive analytics problems, organized into five key topics:

### Files Included:
1. **Decision_Tree_Gini_Index.xlsx**: 
   - **Description**: This file includes a detailed solution for decision tree splits using the **Gini Index** criterion. It shows how to determine the optimal split point by calculating Gini indices and combined Gini scores.

2. **Clustering_Normalization.xlsx**: 
   - **Description**: This file demonstrates **clustering analysis** using normalized variables. The data points have been standardized, and clustering assignments are provided to help understand data groupings.

3. **KNN_Predictive_Analytics.xlsx**:
   - **Description**: This file includes predictive analysis using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm, including logistic regression details to support the classification decisions.

4. **Binary_Classification_Logistic_Regression.xlsx**:
   - **Description**: This file contains problems related to **binary classification** using **logistic regression**. It explains the logistic regression model, the coefficients used, and the decision-making process for binary outcomes.

5. **Centroid_Clustering.xlsx**:
   - **Description**: This sheet focuses on **centroid-based clustering** using distance metrics to assign data points to different clusters. The distances to centroids (`A` and `B`) are calculated, and cluster assignments are made accordingly.


## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: All solutions were calculated and documented using Excel.
